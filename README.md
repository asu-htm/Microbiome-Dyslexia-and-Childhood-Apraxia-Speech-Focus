# Neuro-Microbiome-Exploration-Dyslexia-and-Apraxia-Focus
This study provides novel insights into the microbiome’s role in neurodevelopment, offering potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the scripts, data, and documentation for a study investigating the gut and oral microbiome in individuals with dyslexia and apraxia. Dyslexia and apraxia are neurodevelopmental disorders affecting language processing and motor coordination, respectively. While traditionally studied from neurological and genetic perspectives, emerging research suggests that the gut-brain and oral-brain axes may play a crucial role in these conditions.

This project aims to characterize microbial communities in the gut and oral microbiome to explore their potential contributions to neurological function. Using Illumina 16S sequencing data, we characterize the microbial diversity, composition, and functional potential of individuals with dyslexia and apraxia. Sequencing data was deposited in the NCBI SRA website with the accession ID: PRJNA1246995. 

### Objectives 

- Characterize the microbial community of individuals with dyslexia/apraxia and their neurotypical family members.
- Investigate the presence of specific microbial taxa and metabolic pathways that may be linked to these phenotypes.
